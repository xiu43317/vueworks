# shoppingcart

> A Vue project. This project is practicing the concepts of Vue.js. I use todolist,shoppingcart,opendata and login to learn Website basic functions.
On login page, you can switch the language options. Without login, you may be prohibited to access to other pages. On opendata page, I fetch the opendata
from cloud and you can search the information by select area or enter keywords. On shop page, you can choose the limited goods and go to shopping cart page
to see what item you choose. You also can modify the number on this page which also has max and min number limits. After you confirm the shopping cart list,
you can press the file icon to see your order. At last, the typical todolist is the fundamental for all beginners. To add, delete and update schedules and 
filter different type items.
